        <p><h1>Information Technology and Its Role During COVID-19</h1></p>
            <p><big>As we entered into a brand new year and a new decade, many people got excited about the possibilities 2020 promised. 
                People chose new year’s resolutions like more travel, more savings, or learning new skills. 
                Many businesses planned to start the new decade on the right foot, with detailed business plans and quarterly goals already estimated. 
                No one could have expected that a couple of months later, the world would be on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19.

                The novel coronavirus disease has forced health authorities and government officials to urge people into quarantine, allowing them to leave the safety of their homes under specific circumstances – purchasing essential items, work (if deemed essential workers), or seeking medical attention.
                 With people only going out to get essential items and for work, the world comes to a standstill to ensure disease control and prevention. 
                The severity and reach of the coronavirus pandemic have drastically changed our everyday lives. In the middle of all the chaos and confusion the virus brings, it seems that information technology has a crucial role in maintaining a sense of normality. We are going to look at the ways in which IT has helped us in tackling the disruption caused by COVID19.
                
                If you have found yourself in need of a career change due to COVID19, a field with job security like Information Technology might be the right fit for you. </big></p>
